# General instructions for running the programs

## Question-1

the program will be run as 
```
    ./q1.sh <filename>
```
A text file named q1_a.txt will be generated for the A part, and the combined output of part A and B will be directed to the terminal itself

## Question 2

the program will be run as 
```
    ./q2.sh quotes.txt
```
the output file " speech.txt " will contain the desired output

## Question 3

the program will be run as
```
    ./q3.sh <filename>
```
the output for all the parts will be directed to the terminal itself

Note: the 'e' part may take a few seconds to run

## Question 4

the program will be run as 
```
    ./q4.sh <input>
```
example of the input: 12,43,4,65,76

so an example of running the program is 
```
    ./q4.sh 12,43,4,65,76
```

the output of the program will be directed to the terminal and will look like:
```
the original array is: 12,43,4,65,76
the sorted array is: 4,12,43,65,76
```

## Question 5

the program will be run as 
```
    ./q5.sh <string>
```
NOTE: since the format called for the parts to be clubbed together, it is assumed that string length will be even

the output for the all the parts will be directed to the terminal itself
